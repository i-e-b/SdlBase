/*
    Exposes replacements for malloc, calloc and free.
    Maintains a stack of memory arenas, where allocations and deallocations can be made; and all deallocated at once.

    Uses the most recently pushed Arena.
    Uses the stdlib versions if no arenas have been pushed, or if not set up.
    When an arena is popped from the manager, it is deallocated
*/

/*

    The arena allocator holds an array of large-ish chunks of memory.

    To get an allocated chunk of memory, we use the arena `Allocate`.
    We can optionally free memory with `Deallocate` when we know it's not going to be used.

    Once we don't need any of the memory anymore, we can close the arena, which deallocates all
    memory contained in it.

    Return values can either be copied out of the closing arena into a different one,
    or be written as produced to another arena.

    At the moment, the maximum allocated chunk size inside an arena is 64K. Use one of the
    container classes to exceed this.
